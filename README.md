# log
Example Usage:
bash
Copy
# Search for the term "error" in log files located in the ./logs directory and filter for "example.com"
$ python log_finder.py ./logs error --website example.com

# Search for multiple terms ("404", "timeout") in logs for "example.com" and save results to "website_errors.txt"
$ python log_finder.py ./logs 404 timeout --website example.com --output website_errors.txt
Example Output (search_results.txt):

How It Works:
Website Filtering: When you provide the --website argument, the script will filter log entries to include only those that contain the given website/domain in the url or referrer fields.
Search Terms: You can still search for any terms you want (like "error", "404", etc.), and the script will match those terms in the log entries for the specified website.
Parallel Processing: The log search still operates in parallel using threads, which makes it fast when processing multiple log files.
Extending Further:
Date Filter: Allow filtering by a date range in the logs (e.g., only logs from the last week or month).
Refined Search: Add more advanced search options like filtering based on HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) or specific response codes (404, 500).
Web Interface: If you'd like to expand this tool into a more user-friendly interface, you could integrate it into a web dashboard where users can specify input fields for search terms and website URLs.

To run the script I provided, you need to follow these steps. I'll guide you through the process.

1. Set Up Your Environment
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux):

bash
Copy
python --version
If Python is installed, it will show the version number (e.g., Python 3.9.1). If not, you can download and install Python from the official website.

2. Download or Copy the Script
Copy the code I provided into a file and save it with a .py extension, such as log_finder.py.
3. Prepare the Log Files
Place the log files you want to search in a directory on your computer. For example, you can create a directory named logs and place your .log files there.
Example:

lua
Copy
/path/to/logs/
    access.log
    error.log
    app.log
4. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt)
Windows: Open Command Prompt (you can search for "cmd" in the Start menu).
macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal application.
5. Navigate to the Script Directory
Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the folder where you saved the Python script (log_finder.py).

For example:

bash
Copy
cd /path/to/script/directory
You can check the current directory with pwd (on macOS/Linux) or cd (on Windows) to make sure you're in the right folder.

6. Run the Script
Once you're in the correct directory, run the script using Python by typing the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
python log_finder.py /path/to/logs error --website example.com --output search_results.txt
Explanation of the command:

/path/to/logs: Path to the directory where your .log files are located.
error: This is the search term. The script will search for "error" in the logs.
--website example.com: This is an optional argument where you're filtering logs to include only those related to the website "example.com".
--output search_results.txt: This optional argument specifies the name of the output file where results will be saved. If not provided, the default output file will be search_results.txt.
Example Command (with specific paths):
If your script is saved in C:/Users/YourName/log_finder.py and your log files are in C:/logs/, you would run:

bash
Copy
python C:/Users/YourName/log_finder.py C:/logs/ error --website example.com --output result.txt
7. View the Results
After running the command, the script will process the log files in the specified directory and search for the term (e.g., error) and any logs related to example.com (if you specified a website).
It will save the results in the specified output file (search_results.txt in this example).
You can open the output file (search_results.txt) with any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, VSCode) to view the results.
Example of a Full Run:
Suppose you have logs in /logs/ and you want to search for 404 errors related to example.com.

Run the command:

bash
Copy
python log_finder.py /logs/ 404 --website example.com --output 404_errors.txt
The script will search through all .log files in /logs/ for the term 404 and filter by the website example.com.

Once the search is complete, you'll see this message in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Search complete. Results saved to 404_errors.txt
Open 404_errors.txt to view the results:

yaml
Copy
File: /logs/access.log Line: 102
IP Address: 192.168.0.1 | URL: /page-not-found | Response Code: 404
Method: GET | User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64) AppleWebKit/537.36
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes:
Make sure Python is properly installed: You may need to use python3 instead of python on macOS or Linux, depending on your Python installation:

bash
Copy
python3 --version  # Check if Python 3 is installed
python3 log_finder.py /path/to/logs error
Log File Formats: This script assumes the log files are in the Apache/Nginx combined log format. If your logs are in a different format, you may need to adjust the parse_log_line function to match the structure of your log files.
